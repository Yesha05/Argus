Annexure -2 
 
Illustrative Example of 3% interest subvention to be given to one lakh students every year on education loan for students with annual family income up to ? 8 lakhs.  
 
 
o The student has taken an Education loan of ? 30 lakhs for a 2 year course. 
o Out of 30 lakhs, in first year (2024-25), depending on students’ and QHEI’s requirement, Rs ? 16 lakhs is disbursed by the bank at one go.  
o Let us assume that 8.5% interest rate is being charged by bank.  
o As simple interest rate is charged by banks during moratorium period, an interest of Rs ? 1.36 lakhs will be due in FY 2025-26.  
o Interest subvention is provided for loan amount up to Rs 10 lakhs. On ? 10 lakhs, @3% interest for one year, interest will be ? 30,000 
o Thus, in 2025-26, student will pay ? 1.06 lakhs and central government will pay ? 30,000.  o Further, in 2025-26, Bank disburses remaining Rs 14 lakhs for second year to student. 
o In second year also, government shall pay subsidy of 3% on Rs 10 lakh outstanding. Student shall pay remaining interest.  
o Thus, in 2026-27, student shall pay ?2.25 lakhs interest and central government shall pay ? 30,000 interest. 
o Since 2027-28 is the last year of moratorium period, student shall pay ?2.25 lakhs interest and central government shall pay ? 30,000 interest. 
o However, if the student repays ? 25 lakhs after 2nd year and remaining outstanding is only ? 
5 lakhs, then interest accrued in 2027-28 is ?42,500. 3% interest on outstanding amount is ?15,000. Therefore, student pays ?27,500 and central government pays ?15,000 as interest for this year. 
o After moratorium period (course + 1 yr) period is over, student shall repay entire principal and interest and government shall not pay any amount.

a) First, all 3000 applications from government HEIs will be selected, 
b) Among 2000 applicants from private HEIs, priority will be given to professional/ technical courses. Suppose 1500 applications are from professional/ technical courses.  
c) Among 1500 applications, priority will be given to those who have passed higher secondary from government institutions. Suppose 300 passed higher secondary from govt. institutions. These 300 will be selected. 
d) For remaining 1200 applicants, priority will be given to those who have passed secondary from government institutions. Suppose 50 passed secondary from govt. institutions. These 50 will be selected 
e) For remaining 1150 applicants, priority will be given to those who have passed higher secondary from rural school. Suppose 50 passed higher secondary from rural schools. These 50 will be selected. 
f) For remaining 1100 students, priority will be given to girl students. Suppose there are 100 girls among these 1100 applicants. Then remining 28 slots will be given to girls with lowest annual income. 
Note that, if some of the states have less applications, the vacant slots of that state shall be allotted to remaining states on pro-rata basis using the inter-state ratios from the above table. That has not been considered in steps (a) to (f) of example 1. 
 
ii. Example 2: In Uttar Pradesh 18,000 applications are received and total slots are 18,895. Then, all applications will be selected. The 895 excess slots will be allotted to remaining states on pro-rata basis. 
Notes:  
1. If a student has passed higher secondary from Uttar Pradesh Board and has been admitted in a HEI at Tamil Nadu, the student will be considered against slot allotted for Uttar Pradesh. 
2. There will be no upper limit on number of applicants from a government HEI. 
3. If total applications from Private HEIs are large, cut-off on number of eligible students from a private HEI will be applied only if total applications exceed the state-wise total slots. Otherwise, information will be sent to remaining HEIs of that state that they need to raise awareness of their students regarding availability of the scheme.
